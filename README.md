# Handwritten-Digit-Recognition_AML_Project
The main objective of this project is to provide efficient and reliable techniques for recognition of  handwritten numerals by comparing various existing classification models. In this project, multiple  learning techniques are examined, and a new accuracy level for recognition of the MNIST dataset is  reported. The main objective of this project is to provide efficient and reliable techniques for recognition of  handwritten numerals by comparing various existing classification models. In this project, multiple  learning techniques are examined, and a new accuracy level for recognition of the MNIST dataset is  reported. MNIST is a widely used dataset for the hand-written digit classification task. It consists of 70,000 labeled 28x28 pixel grayscale images of hand-written digits. The dataset is split into 60,000 training images and 10,000 test images. There are 10 classes (one for each of the 10 digits). The task at hand is to train a model using the 60,000 training images and subsequently test its classification accuracy on the 10,000 test images.
